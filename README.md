# Assignment-2
Assignment 2 of Android club
\
The objective of this assignment is to implement the playist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy9JCsy2u97kphtlKAAMogqZnEt2L0NhD.
\
\
This playlist contains basics of stack and tab navigations which we should perform. 
\
\
In my app I have 5 screens as of now : Home,Lobby,Friends,Camera and Settings. 
\
As we have to use 2 types of navigation for this assignment I have used both stack and tab navigation working together in this app.
\
\
For this process we need to install some important requirements using the codes shown below:
\
\
npm install @react-navigation/native ( To install react navigation)
\
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
\
npm install @react-navigation/stack (To implement stack navigation)
\
npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs (To implement tab navigation)
\
